\emph{ I wanted to thank professor Patrignani, for giving me the opportunity of
being part of this amazing project, and learn everything that I learned. Without
his support and help, this project would have never been possible. I also wanted
to thank Tiziano Marinaro, one of the researchers I had the chance to work with,
that has always been extremely supportive and willing to help, give opinion and suggestions.
He has been crucial for allowing me understanding the complex details of the
project. A big thank goes to my family, that has always been supportive with me
the whole time of my studies in this bachelor, and made all of this possible. My
parents, my sister and my brother, even though not in in technical fields, have always
been the biggest and most important support I could have. I am extremely
grateful for all of this. \\}
