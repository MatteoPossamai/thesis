\chapter{Related Works}
\label{cha:related_works}The paper that has been the most important for this
thesis is that of Linder, Guanciale and Metere et al. \cite{bir_pub}. This article
that I refered multiple times in this thesis, is focused mainly in the automated
verification of binary files, proving their validity and correctness. To
archieve this goal, the authors created a new language, called Binary
Intermediate Representation (BIR), that could describe the Instruction Set Architecture
(ISA) of a CPU in a platform-independent way, to pursue their goals. This is the
birth of the BIR language, that has been used in this thesis. The article's writers
are also part of the same research group that I have been part of, so the
stimuli and the ideas that have been developed in this paper have been the base
of the motivation for using BIR in the Malcos codebase.

Also, another important piece of reseach for the scope of this thesis has been the
research done by Microsoft researchers, in particular in Oleksii Oleksenko, Christof
Fetzer, Boris Köpf, Mark Silberstein et al. \cite{article}. This article is where
the Revizor tool has been presented, and some vulnerabilities of some CPUs were
discovered. Since Revizor is a crucial part of this project as a whole, and
something I had the opportunity to touch with my works, it was worth reading this
article to better understand the tool and its capabilities, to then also
understand better how the Malcos project used it.

Once last relevant piece of research that has been important for this thesis is
Marco Guarnieri, Boris Köpf, Jan Reineke, and Pepe Vila. at el. \cite{contracts_paper}.
In this paper, the authors describe the hardware and the software contracts that
are required for secure speculation. In this paper, the concepts of contracts and
speculation could be better understood. This paper has been important for the
thesis, since it allowed me to fully understand some concepts around the speculation
and contracts. This is also a foundation paper for the Malcos project, since Marco
Guarnieri, one of the author, is one of the main contributors to the Malcos project,
and has also been one on the Revizor codebase.

TODO: Compare and discuss the differences between the works that has been done in
this project and other similar or related ones in the field.
