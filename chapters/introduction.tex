\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

Micro-architectural Leakage Contract Synthesis (Malcos) is a synthesis engine
for generating contracts representing speculation behavior of black-box CPUs. It
is currently under the development of a research team made with researchers from
University of Trento, Imdea and KTH. The goal of this project is to provide a tool
that can synthesise speculation contracts of black box CPUs, providing more
information about their behavior. This is done to then, in futher steps, be able
to inspect vulnerabilities of CPU and correctly and automatically patch them,
from a platform-dependent point of view. The tool is written mainly in Python and
Racket, using the Revizor (\cite{article},\cite{repo}, \cite{misc}) tool and the
Rosette language. As the time of this thesis, the project is not open-source,
but the plan is to make it public once it is completed, tested and validated.

At the beginning of the project, the team develped and used a Domain Specific
Language (DSL) to write and describe the specifications of the CPU contracts. But
once the project started to grow, they saw that the language was not the right
fit for the project. The DSL was not in fact powerful enough, to represent in a
platform-independent way all CPU possible contracts and operations. A new semantic
was therefore needed. Also, a group of researchers of KTH institute involved in the
same topics and also collaborating with the team in others, developed a new
language, called Binary Intermediate Representation (BIR, \cite{bir_pub}), which
they created with the goal of representing the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
of the CPU in a platform-independent, powerful and complete way, to have an universal
language for this purpose. These two factors lead to the decision of migrating
the semantic that the project used for the contract from the DSL to BIR.

To do so, all the current DSL pipeline needed to be replaced by a new one,
suited for the BIR language. It was needed a full rebuild since translating from
BIR to the DSL to then inject it into the tool, and translating the output to
BIR again was not a suitable option. This was because of the fact that BIR is far
more complex then the DSL, and therefore not all the constructs were available. This
meant making the DSL more powerful, or switch directly and entirely to BIR, as has
we did.

Therefore, in this thesis we implement all the new pipeline and logic needed to
handle the BIR language for this particular project, and we validate the correctness
of the final outcome. To be more procise, in this thesis we will implement the parser
for the language, the tracer that interpretes the contract and populates the
trace and the engine for generating the new synthesized contracts.

Also, we thought about whether it would have been worth migrating the pipeline,
or part of it from the native Python, to Rust, a more performant and safe
programming language. In this thesis, we will also explore the research, the proof
of concepts (PoC) developed and the final outcome of this trial, that has been
quite surprising giving the premise.

I wrote and run multiple different tests to validate the correctness of the new
pipleline. The majority of them are unit tests, to test each step of the process
and ensure correct behavior at a local scale, and multiple tests involving all the
moving part. To test the later, I used already tested contracts, and compared
the outcome with the DSL pipeline, to ensure correctness and consistency. In
total, more than 200 tests are present in the codebase contribution of this thesis.

At this point, also, the Malcos project is still under development, but now is
using the BIR language to represent the contract instead of the legacy DSL. This
further validates the work done.

\textbf{Outline}: This thesis is a overview of the contribution done to the Malcos
codebase, exploring all the steps taken, the choice made with their whys, and
proofs the validity of the developed solution.

To do so, Section \ref{cha:background} presents background overview of all the needed
concepts to understand the work and the project we will be talking about, and
all the tools used. Section \ref{cha:core} will be the core of the thesis, with
all the steps taken to transition from the DSL to BIR, the validation of each step
and the assessment of the final results. In addition, in this chapter there will
be all the explaination of the research done to decide whether it was worth migrating
the pipeline from the native Python code to a Rust implementation.
